"""Cross-process populate lock for the mmap dataset cache.

Wraps :class:`filelock.FileLock` in an async-friendly context manager that
mirrors HuggingFace ``WeakFileLock``: periodic INFO log while waiting,
SoftFileLock fallback on filesystems without ``flock``, group-writable
lock files so multiple users sharing a cache contend correctly.

Used by :mod:`aiperf.dataset.mmap_cache` to serialize concurrent populates
on the same cache key. Callers should follow the double-checked pattern:
look up the cache, on miss enter this lock, look up again under the lock,
populate only on second miss.
